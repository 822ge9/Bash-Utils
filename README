prettify.py
    Prettify an HTML page. The script prints the HTML source that is built 
    by BeautifulSoup (BS).
    Idea: if you want to manipulate a page with BS, analyze the prettified 
    source instead of the original because this is how BS stores it.
    Usage: prettify.py <URL>

sp.py
    "show path"
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/show-the-absolute-path-of-a-file/
    Print the absolute path of a file. If no parameter is passed, show the current path.
    Usage: sp.py <filename>
