prettify.py
    "prettify an HTML page"
    Website: https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/prettify-html-with-beautifulsoup/
    The script prints the HTML source that is built 
    by BeautifulSoup (BS).
    Idea: if you want to manipulate a page with BS, analyze the prettified 
    source instead of the original because this is how BS stores it.
    Usage: prettify <URL>

sp.py
    "show path"
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/show-the-absolute-path-of-a-file/
    Print the absolute path of a file. If no parameter is passed, show the current path.
    Usage: sp <filename>

tocb.py
    "to clipboard(s)"
    Website: https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/copy-string-to-x-clipboards/
    Copy the text from the standard input to ALL clipboards. Thus, you can use 
    any paste method to insert your text (middle mouse button or Shift+Insert).
    Usage: cat file.txt | tocb
