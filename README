open_in_tabs.py
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/open-urls-in-browser-tabs-simultaneously/
    Read URLs from the standard input and open them in separated tabs.
    Usage: cat url_list.txt | open_in_tabs
    
markdown.py
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/readme-markdown-on-github/
    Preview markdown files in a browser.
    Usage: markdown.py <file.markdown> [-u]

img_to_base64.py
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/embed-images-in-html-pages/
    Take an image file and encode it with BASE64. Put the encoded data in
    an "img" HTML tag.
    Usage: img_to_base64 <image_file>

alarm.py
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/alarm-script/
    A simple alarm script that plays a list of MP3s at a given time.
    Very useful if you leave your computer switched on during the night.
    Usage: alarm -p
               Play music first to adjust volume.
           alarm -t 7h5
               Set alarm time (5 past 7 in this example).

prettify.py
    "prettify an HTML page"
    Website: https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/prettify-html-with-beautifulsoup/
    The script prints the HTML source that is built 
    by BeautifulSoup (BS).
    Idea: if you want to manipulate a page with BS, analyze the prettified 
    source instead of the original because this is how BS stores it.
    Usage: prettify <URL>

sp.py
    "show path"
    Website: https://ubuntuincident.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/show-the-absolute-path-of-a-file/
    Print the absolute path of a file. If no parameter is passed, show the current path.
    Usage: sp <filename>

tocb.py
    "to clipboard(s)"
    Website: https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/copy-string-to-x-clipboards/
    Copy the text from the standard input to ALL clipboards. Thus, you can use 
    any paste method to insert your text (middle mouse button or Shift+Insert).
    Usage: cat file.txt | tocb
